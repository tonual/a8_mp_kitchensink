LIMITAITOTNS:

Atari 8-bit systems (like the 800/XL/XE where MPT runs) have a 64KB address space ($0000 to $FFFF).

The script assumes samples load starting at the specified --start-addr (default $9000), 
with each subsequent sample placed right after the previous one (post-padding).

The total packed data size (after 4-bit conversion, packing two samples per byte, 
and padding each to the next 256-byte boundary) cannot push the final sample's end address beyond $FFFF.


LIMITS
packed to .d8 .d15
~28KB 

Max total duration: ~3.8 seconds (?)


Limitation,                                                 8kHz (.d8),             15kHz (.d15)
"Max total duration (seconds, across all samples)",         ~7.17s,                 ~3.82s
"Max packed data size (bytes, post-padding)",               28672,                  28672
"Max 8-bit unpacked size (bytes, post-SoX)",                57344,                  57344
Max 4-bit samples (pre-packing),                            57344,                  57344
Max samples count,                                          16,16
Max input WAV estimate (16-bit mono @44.1kHz),              ~600-700KB,             ~335-350KB
